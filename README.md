## Current Projects
###Coin Detector
 - Uses GetPosition.py then CoinDetector.py
 - https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/lego-robotics/lego-coin-detector/v/lego-nxt-coin-detector
 - Refer to code to see what ports are used

###Make your robot a Rumba
 - Uses rumba.py
 - Make a robot with two touch sensors and two motors bounce off a wall and keep going
 - Refer to code to see what ports are used
 - The code is pretty crude, it was more about the process of building the robot and trial and error of the code
